      <h1>Pollution around the World</h1>
      <p class="lead">Top 10 of the most polluted countries in the World.</p>
      <strong>To calculate the top 10 list of the most polluted countries in the World the scientist used something called the PM 2.5 reading that refers to the atmospheric particle matter with the diameter les than 2.5 micrometers and the amount of pollution in milligrams per cubic meter, and many consider that the PM 2.5 to be the best indicator of how healthy the air is or how polluted.</strong>
<p>India is number 10 on the list with the PM 2.5 reading has an average of 59 milligrams per cubic metre, a figure considered to be unhealthy on the air quality index scale. This level of air quality is said to increase aggravation of hart and lung disease and has respiratory implications on those ho breathed in, and increases the chance of premature death considerably.
</p><p>Number 9 on the list is Mongolia that has long winters and a population with 2.7 million that needs to heat them selves to survive this cold and long winters meaning that they have to burn a lot of coal that creates significant air pollution problems so much that puts the Mongolian capital city Ulaanbaatar on the list of the most polluted cities in the world having the average PM 2.5 readings of 64 milligrams of pollution per cubic meter, and a district in Ulaanbaatar once on a daily peak was recorded 1,071 mg of pollution per cubic meter being considered extremely hazardous on the air quality index.</p>
    <p>On number 8 we have the United Arab Emirates country that is known for its huge oil and gas industries, has an average of PM 2.5 readings between 61 to 70 mg of pollution per cubic meter. The U.A.E is considered one of the richest parts of the World with almost everyone owning a car or a big car in order to past the dusty desert meaning that U.A.E is polluted and dusty.</p>
      <p>Number seven on the list is taken by Egypt with the average PM 2.5 of 74 mg per cubic meter witch in terms of the air quality index is unhealthy. The main problem is in the city of Cairo which affects the whole country having a lot of cars, factories, and old fashion heating devices, powerplants and dust, making the air pollution 20 times more that is acceptable.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh is number 6 on the list with an average pollution of 79 mg of pollution per cubic meter which is considered unsafe. Air quality in the Bangladeshi cities is not good, three of the country cities appear in the top 25 most polluted cities in the World and figures show that air quality of this country has nose dived by 60% in the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>Number 5 on the list is Iran that the air in this country contains a lot of rubber particles, asbestos, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide. The country overall PM 2.5 is 76 mg of pollution per cubic meter and in the city of Abbas the data went over chart with well over 1000 mg pollution per cubic meter.</p>
      <p>On number 4 is Afghanistan with the city of Kabul that recorded 3,000 deaths each year due to the air pollution. Surrounded by mountains pollution is retained more making many parts of the country dangerous with many burning rubber and plastic to stay warm and the PM 2.5 is 84 mg of pollution per cubic meter.</p>
      <p>Qatar is on number 3 with a PM reading of 92 mg of pollution per cubic meter. A small but verry busy, a large proportion of the pollution coming from traffic congestion and air traffic with many flights landing and taking of in Qatar. The city of Doha is ranked by the World Health Organization one of the most polluted cities in the World. </p>
      <p>Pakistan is number 2 on the list with a report made by the World Bank in 2014 reads “Pakistan urban air pollution is among the most severe in the World and engenders significant damage to human health and the economy” recording in 2012 59,241 deaths caused by pollution. PM range 68 to 101 mg of pollution per cubic meter.</p>
      <p>First place is China with a million deaths every year due to pollution and the PM 2.5 readings between 72.57 mg pollution per cubic meter, and two of Chinas cities occupies spot one and two on the list with the most polluted cities in the World. This is mainly because of their fumes from their industrial output such as coal burning and lead industries. Emitting around 30% of the Worlds greenhouse gases and so many people in China can be seen wearing masks because of the pollution and some Chinese they order bottles with clean air from Canada and Iceland.</p>
