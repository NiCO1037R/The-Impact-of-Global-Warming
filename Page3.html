      <h1>Climate Change and Natural Disasters</h1>
      <!--<p class="lead">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>-->
      <strong><p>Extreme weather is now become a common almost daily news. In July 2019 the UK has seen his highest temperatures ever while the US had is second hottest year and second wettest year on record. So far 2019 holds the highest temperature records around the world with several countries having the hottest summer months ever recorded. As are climate continuous to change natural disasters are on the rise, 2019 having the record with the most active cyclones on period with the biggest and devastating category 5 hurricane named Dorian killing at least 70 people living 70,000 homeless. 
In the same year Australia has experienced the worst bush fire season in the living memory of this small Continent and has fuelled debates around the relationship between climate change and natural disasters once again. 
But how exactly natural disasters can be affected by climate change:
          Well, Climate Change refers to changes of weather over a long period of time and many of the ways we measure climate points to over Global Warming trend, and the Planet getting hotter can influence extreme weather events in a number of ways, a couple Examples:</p></strong>
        <strong><p>a) Wildfires – rising temperatures means the period of drought are more common and last longer, and when is less moisture in the earth because of increase temperatures, things can catch fire and spread more easily. In Australia while climate change cannot be pinned down as a direct cause of bushfires, scientist they said that this hotter dried climate has led to the fires to be more intense.<p/></strong>
        <strong>b) Local Ecosystems – A dry climate also impacts on Ecosystems and plants and animals behave differently when their environment changes can influence natural disasters. Example: the relationship between the bug beetles and the wildfires in California. When the trees there are weakened by drought, they also become more vulnerable to attacks from this bug beetles that going inside the tree and kill it. In some areas in California more than three quarters of the trees are killed by this beetle living millions of dry trees ready to catch fire.</strong>

<strong>A hotter world does not mean that just affects fires and droughts. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing see levels to rise and a warmer atmosphere also holds more water which means that heavy rain is more likely, and flooding is more common and of course the effect on hurricanes. Warmer air and oceans temperature results in hurricanes become more intense while higher see levels mean that storm surges are bigger and ultimately cause more damage. Hurricanes are categorised by their wind speed and because warmer temperatures allow forming hurricanes to pick up more energy, category 4 and 5 hurricanes are becoming more likely to take place. Experts predict hurricanes in these highest categories to double in frequency by the end of the century. 
Natural disasters have always happened but throughout human history we have not had the ability to influence nature on such a large scale that it can actually change the climate. Now we do and we have, and as long the temperatures of our World continue to rise and we can expect events like fires, drought, flooding and hurricanes to happen more often and on a bigger scale.
