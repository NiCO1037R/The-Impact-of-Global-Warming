      <h1>UK Transition to Zero Carbon Emission</h1>
      <!--<p class="lead">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>-->
      <p>The carbon footprint is visible from space and that humanity has relayed almost exclusively on fossil fuels for power, heat and light.
In 2019 Britain has become the first major economy to turn its back on fossil fuels wit an ambitious project that will bring carbon footprint down to zero. It is technically possible considering that onshore wind energy is now cheaper than gas, and because net zero brigs’ jobs and opportunities.
Effectively is a new industrial revolution and a massive transition away from fossil fuels to new ways of generating power, new transportation methods and new forms of manufacturing and backing energy efficiency in our homes.
This transition to a cleaner and more sustainable environment will also mean a transition to cleaner and more sustainable economy by 2050.
</p>
        <h1>Scotland’s Climate Change Bill</h1>
        <p>Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. Because we need to make things right, in 2019 Scotland has introduce the Climate Change Bill considered the toughest in the World with a target to reduce the emissions with 90% by 2050 giving a target for every year between now and then. Un like other countries Scotland’s target is to reduce our emissions here in Scotland.
Some independent experts saying that is to reduce carbon emissions with 90% by 2050, is at the verry limit of feasibility, but Scotland ambition is as soon as it reaches the target of 90%, we will go further to reduce Carbon emissions with 100% and we’ll be held to account by the world’s toughest legislation, and proudly leading the fight against climate change.
</p>
        <p>We are facing an urgent crisis that threatens our very existence called a Climate Catastrophe. The climate stability of the past 12,000 year has come to an end, and around the world we are now suffering from the impact. Bleached coral reefs becoming cemeteries, polar regions melting, and species driven to extinction.
It does not make any sense if we think that we are the most intellectual creature on the planet that we are destroying our Planet.
We are at a critical juncture in our Planet history, and what each one of us does in the next ears will determine what will happen in the next few thousand years and will define our legacy to all future generations.
