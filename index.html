      <h1>The Impact of Global Warming</h1>
      <p class="lead">Greenhouse gases and their effect over Global Warming.</p>
        <strong>Studies made by some researchers has shown that we might already be at the tipping point that might lead to so called “non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental to planetary scale system”(The New Humanitarian, 2019). The greenhouse gases are responsible for warming the planet allowing direct sunlight to reach Earth’s surface and keeping the minimum optimum temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, the temperature that is necessary to keep life on Earth well and liveable. The quantity of Greenhouse gases is also responsible for allowing how much heat to escape or be reflected into space or how much of this heat is trapped in the lower atmosphere or reflected to Earth. There are two types of greenhouse gases. First are the natural greenhouse gases like water vapour, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and carbon dioxide that occurs naturally on the Planet. Second are the synthetic greenhouse gases also called fluorinated gases and all greenhouse gases resulted from human activities such as the Industrial Revolution and the coal-powered engines, machines and factories that helped human civilisation to evolve have vastly increased the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere and increased carbon dioxide by 40% and methane by 150%, and nitrous oxide by 20% between 1750 and 2011. On top of that since 1920s fluorinated gases like man-made chlorofluorocarbons started to be added to this mix of greenhouse gases. Clearly the concentration of greenhouse gases jumped considerably, human activities having a huge “contribution” to the increase concentration of these man-made greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels and deforestation plays a huge negative role to Global Warming or Global Pollution as I like to call it. Is true that this greenhouse gases can be “washed” away by the nature, plants, soil, oceans, and forests as long they exist or not get oversaturated by pollution or destroyed.
The real and threatening danger lies in something that our civilisation really depends on not happening, which is weakening the stability of glaciers and permafrost. Apart for the hydrologic danger that can result with massive flooding’s around the world if the glaciers melt, their eventual melt can increase the global temperature at an alarming scale by releasing huge quantities of greenhouse gases from the permafrost into the atmosphere facilitating the heat absorption and retention into the atmosphere.
Scientists say that we are 1.5 degree Celsius away from this danger that threatens the world as we know it, and probably our existence. Our environment is the huge complex system that is around us and includes the land we live on, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the climate around us and we must work together to ensure that the development in some areas do not affect the environment and climate around us while we ensure and mitigate any damage that has occurred so far and prevent any future damage to the place we live, our only Home.

      <h1>The Arctic</h1>
      <p class="lead">People opinions and Scientist’s data and predictions on Arctic</p>
      <strong>Some people say if we look back over the history of the planet there been ice ages and heat waves and natural extreme temperature fluctuations and that is just part of living on planet Earth.
          
 Scientist saying It is true that are natural cycles in climate, but what is happening now in the Arctic is that the human activity has become the dominant agent of change to the Arctic and worldwide climate. In the last about 150 years, the climate change that we observe today is at least 80% due to the human activity “we are now a force of nature”.
The rise of world’s sea levels are caused by the contribution of massive amounts of water caused by the Antarctic ice melt – but a new analysis in the past 20 years of satellite data indicates that is not as linear or consistent as the scientist previously thought, but the danger is steel present and measures needs to be taken now in order to prevent it.</strong>
